Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat you as bound by the changes on the first renewal date for your subscription after the effective date and so you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before this renewal date if you don't like the proposed changes.</p>

            <p> <b> Virtual Currencies</b><br> In certain of our games, we offer certain virtual currencies for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. Virtual currencies can be redeemed (ie used) to acquire certain digital goods / services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain virtual currency, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.</p> 
            <p> PLEASE TAKE NOTE that virtual currencies are subject to very important restrictions:</p> 
            <p> Virtual currency expires and will be deleted if it has not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition so you should redeem it as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the virtual currency or, if we haven't specified a time limit, three months from acquisition.</p> 
            <p> Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currency can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired it. Each game may contain one or more virtual currencies. We may at any time change or remove any or any type of Item for which virtual currency can be redeemed as well as the amount of virtual currency needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem virtual currency for Items on offer at the time of redemption. Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currencies are specific to a particular Jagex Product, and one virtual currency used in relation to one Jagex Product may not be exchanged for another virtual currency for use in relation to another Jagex Product. In addition, unless otherwise stated, each virtual currency is independent and is not exchangeable for any other virtual currency in the same Jagex Product.</p> 
            <p> Virtual currency does not have any inherent value and is not your own private property. You can only use them to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for virtual currency. We do not provide any cash or refunds for virtual currency (except as required by law) and virtual currency does not have any real-world value. Virtual currency is for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer it or make it available to anyone else or attempt to do so or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual currency and Items have no monetary value. Virtual currency and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of virtual currency and Items. For example we may cap the amount of virtual currency which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to certain persons, such as those who have separately acquired a subscription.</p> 
            <p> </p>
            <p> We may restrict access to or delete virtual currency or Items: (1) as outlined under "Our Rights" above; (2) if the virtual currency was awarded in error; or (3) if a payment for virtual currency is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed.</p> 
            <p> We may at any time decide to end the entire virtual currency program for all or any of our games. Before we delete the unused virtual currency, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.</p> 
            <p> <b> Privacy policy</b><br> For a description of how we use your personal data, please see our <a href="../../jagex.com/privacy/privacy.html">Privacy policy</a>.</p> 
            <p> <b> Functioning of Jagex Products</b><br> We will use reasonable endeavours to maintain operation of Jagex Products and rectify faults as quickly as possible. We may have to suspend operation of a Jagex Product without notice for repair, maintenance, improvement or other technical reason. If so, we will do our best to ensure that the suspension is as short as possible. We cannot accept responsibility for such suspensions or for any interruption or error caused by circumstances outside our reasonable control.</p>

We make no promises about those sites or their content, products or services as these are outside our reasonable control.</p> 
            <p> <b> OUR AND YOUR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY</b><br> WE DO NOT ACCEPT LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY US OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE (A) THERE IS NO BREACH OF A LEGAL DUTY OF CARE OWED TO YOU BY US OR BY ANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS; (B) SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE IS NOT A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF ANY SUCH BREACH; OR (C) SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE RELATES TO A BUSINESS.

            <p> <b> Transfer</b><br> We may transfer all or part of our rights or duties under this agreement provided we take reasonable steps to ensure that your rights under this agreement are not prejudiced. As this agreement is personal to you, you may not transfer any of your rights or duties under it without our prior written consent.</p> 
            <p> <b> General</b><br> Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your statutory rights as a consumer. Headings above are for guidance only and not binding. If we fail to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions, that failure will not preclude us from enforcing either that provision (or any similar provision) on a later occasion. If any provision of these terms and conditions is found by a court to be invalid, we agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions remain in full force and effect. Except for clauses excluding or restricting our liability a person who is not a party to this agreement shall have no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement. These terms and conditions are governed by English law and any dispute connected with them or Jagex Products will be decided only by the courts of the United Kingdom.</p>
