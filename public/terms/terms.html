                  <p> <b>Terms &amp; Conditions</b></p> 
                  <p> <b>Introduction</b><br> This website is owned and operated by Jagex Limited ("Jagex"), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706). Our registered office is at St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.</p> 
                  <p> <b>Definitions</b><br> "Jagex Product(s)" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games.</p> 
                  <p>References to "Stopping" an account include all or any of: locking, temporarily or permanently banning, or temporarily or permanently muting the account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account at all. NB Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.</p> 
                  <p> <b>Applicability</b><br> Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please don't accept them or use the Jagex product.</p> 
                  <p>If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at <img style="vertical-align: bottom" src="../img/privacy/lawcontact.gif" alt=""> and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.</p> 
                  <p> <b>Changes</b><br> We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: changes in applicable laws; regulatory or security requirements; relevant guidance or codes of practice; technical alterations to Jagex Products; and to improve clarity and consistency. Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat you as bound by the changes on the first renewal date for your subscription after the effective date and so you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before this renewal date if you don't like the proposed changes.</p> 
                  <p> <b>A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br> Jagex’s products (RuneScape, War of Legends, Stellar Dawn and FunOrb) and Jagex’s websites are not targeted to users under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, from 24 November 2010 you will not be permitted to create an account for any of these products. If you are under 13 years of age and created an account prior to November 24, 2010, you will be allowed to continue playing with the limitations placed on users under 13 years of age as explained below.</p> 
                  <p> If you are under 13 we may be able to direct you to other products that may be suitable for you. If you are under 13 and created an account prior to 24 November 2010, you will be unable to disclose personal data through the game or website. If we find out that any personal data we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it. We recommend that, for existing accounts, parents / guardians should play together with their children. </p>
                  <p> If you are under 13, have created an account prior 24 November 2010 and subscribe to the members' version of our game you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. Nonetheless, we may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.</p> 
                  <p> If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p> 
                  <p> If we are told by a parent / guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.</p> 
                  <p> Parents can find more information about the game and how to contact us in the <a href="../jagex.com/l=0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.html" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p> 
                  <p> <b>Safety / abuse</b><br> Before using any Jagex Product you should read the guides found in our <a href="../kbase/guid/safety_and_security_guidelines.html">Safety &amp; Security Guidelines</a>. It is particularly important to read the <a href="../kbase/guid/play_safely.html">Play Safely Guide</a> and the <a href="../kbase/guid/health_amp_safety.html">Health &amp; Safety Guide</a>. Parents of those under 18 should review our safety materials in the <a href="../jagex.com/l=0/corporate/Parents_Guide/safety.html" target="_blank">Player Safety</a> section of the <a href="../jagex.com/l=0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.html" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p> 
                  <p> Whilst we reserve the right to monitor and take action if any Jagex Product is used inappropriately (including the posting of objectionable material on the chat facility or otherwise), we cannot promise that any Jagex Product won't contain such content or that we will remove / modify any particular content. Nor can we guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions or otherwise behave appropriately.</p> 
                  <p> If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should use the built-in facilities to block the messages. (See <a href="../kbase/guid/controls_friends.html">this article</a> for guidance on blocking messages.) You should report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game <a href="../kbase/guid/how_do_i_report_abuse.html">"Report abuse"</a> button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Product(s).</p> 
                  <p> <b>Your account</b><br> To use many features of Jagex Products, we require you to create an account.

                  <p> You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified on our site or our Rules of Conduct. We reserve the right to make such assessment in our sole discretion, change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.</p> 
                  <p> You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person.

Any use of any Jagex Product not in accordance with the game rules exceeds the scope of the license granted by these Terms &amp; Conditions.</p> 
                  <p> <b>Our rights</b><br> If, acting reasonably, we consider that our Terms and Conditions have or may have been breached, or that there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity, or that it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public, we may Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts of Jagex Products which we think are connected with the offender subject to such right of appeal as is specified on our website and/or restrict access to or delete JCredits or anything acquired by means of JCredits. Such actions may result in loss of membership credit and/or loss of real money paid as part of any item / account trading or other prohibited transaction.</p> 
                  <p> To prevent or remedy breach of our Terms and Conditions or any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product or to other players or the general public , we may automatically or manually monitor, censor (including rejection or removal of any content) and/or record public or private chat or other activities in any Jagex Product.</p>

                  <p> You agree that all intellectual property or other rights in any game character, account and items are and will remain our property.</p> 
                  <p> By posting chat or other materials on any Jagex Product, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty free, worldwide license to use and/or modify such materials on any Jagex Product as we see fit.</p> 
                  <p> You agree that by submitting any material of any kind to us for any purpose connected with any Jagex Product (non-exhaustive examples are suggestions and ideas for any game or contributions to any Gallery page), you are giving us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and/or modify the submitted materials as we see fit.

                  <p> <b> Subscription</b><br> You need a subscription to use certain features of Jagex Products. If you apply for a subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including without limit your credit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent as applicable. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.</p> 
                  <p> By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received or if you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).</p> 
                  <p> <u>All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).</u></p>

                  <p> We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees / terms.</p> 
                  <p> We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.</p> 
                  <p> <b> Cancellation by you</b><br> You may cancel your subscription at any time by <a href="../secure/m=billing_core/unsubscribe.html">clicking here</a> or selecting the "Cancel Subscription" link from the account management section on the website of any Jagex Product.</p> 
                  <p> Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused membership credit in the account.</p>

                  <p> <b> JCredits</b><br> In certain of our games, we offer JCredits for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. JCredits can be redeemed (ie used) to acquire certain digital goods / services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain JCredits, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.</p> 
                  <p> PLEASE TAKE NOTE that JCredits are subject to very important restrictions:</p> 
                  <p> JCredits expire and will be deleted if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition so you should redeem them as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the JCredits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, three months from acquisition.</p> 
                  <p> Unless we say otherwise on our website, JCredits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. We may at any time change or remove any or any type of Item for which JCredits can be redeemed as well as the amount of JCredits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem JCredits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.</p> 
                  <p> JCredits do not have any inherent value and they are not your own private property. You can only use them to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for JCredits. We do not provide any cash or refunds for JCredits (except as required by law). JCredits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so or encourage anyone else to do any of these things.</p> 
                  <p> We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of JCredits. For example we may cap the amount of JCredits which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.</p> 
                  <p> We may restrict access to or delete JCredits or Items: (1) as outlined under "Our Rights" above; (2) if the JCredits were awarded in error; or (3) if a payment for JCredits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed.</p> 
                  <p> We may at any time decide to end the entire JCredit program for all or any of our games. Before we delete the unused JCredits, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to redeem them.</p> 
                  <p> <b> Privacy policy</b><br> For a description of how we use your personal data, please see our <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">Privacy policy</a>.</p> 
                  <p> <b> Functioning of Jagex Products</b><br> We will do our best to maintain operation of Jagex Products and rectify faults as quickly as possible. We may have to suspend operation of a Jagex Product without notice for repair, maintenance, improvement or other technical reason. If so, we will do our best to ensure that the suspension is as short as possible. We cannot accept responsibility for such suspensions or for any interruption or error caused by circumstances outside our reasonable control.</p> 
                  <p> We cannot guarantee that Jagex Products will work with any particular computer equipment or in conjunction with any particular software or connectivity services. We do not accept responsibility for such equipment, software or services. </p> 
                  <p> <b> Third parties</b><br> Jagex Products may include links to internet sites or other technologies supplied by third parties including sites / technologies which enable you to pay by means of payment methods provided by third parties. We make no promises about those sites or their content, products or services as these are outside our reasonable control.</p> 
                  <p> <b> OUR AND YOUR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY</b><br> WE DO NOT ACCEPT LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY US OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE (A) THERE IS NO BREACH OF A LEGAL DUTY OF CARE OWED TO YOU BY US OR BY ANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS; (B) SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE IS NOT A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF ANY SUCH BREACH; OR (C) SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE RELATES TO A BUSINESS. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY LEGAL DUTY OF CARE OWED TO YOU BY JAGEX, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.</p> 
                  <p> YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WE SUFFER ARISING FROM YOUR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR MISUSE OF A JAGEX PRODUCT.</p> 
                  <p> <b> Transfer</b><br> We may transfer all or part of our rights or duties under this agreement provided we take reasonable steps to ensure that your rights under this agreement are not prejudiced. As this agreement is personal to you, you may not transfer any of your rights or duties under it without our prior written consent.</p> 
                  <p> <b> General</b><br> Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your statutory rights as a consumer. Headings above are for guidance only and not binding. If we fail to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions, that failure will not preclude us from enforcing either that provision (or any similar provision) on a later occasion. If any provision of these terms and conditions is found by a court to be invalid, we agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions remain in full force and effect. Except for clauses excluding or restricting our liability a person who is not a party to this agreement shall have no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement. These terms and conditions are governed by English law and any dispute connected with them or Jagex Products will be decided only by the courts of the United Kingdom.</p>
